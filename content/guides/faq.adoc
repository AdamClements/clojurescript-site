== Builds

[[slow_dev]]
**<<faq#slow_dev,Why are my dev builds slow?>>**

Make sure that your development classpath does not unnecessarily include test directories. ClojureScript now always recompiles child namespaces and changing a file could easily unintentionally trigger recompilation of all of your tests. Passing `:verbose true` is a simple way to check that the compiler isn't compiling more than it should.
